1. The bug was that the inputs num1 and num2 are strings, so when we calculate result as result = num1 + num2, the result will be the concatenation of the two strings instead of the sum of the number representation of the two strings.

2. Use Number(num1) and Number(num2) to convert the input strings num1, num2 to numbers. In this case, the result would also be a number with the value of the sum of the two numbers.
